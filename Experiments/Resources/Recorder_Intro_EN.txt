The objective of this experiment is to find a particular synthesiser sound as quickly as possible.



The experiment is divided into several cycles, which are made of 3 steps each:

1 - First, during around twenty seconds, you will listen to a sound that will be searched later.

2 - Then, you will be able to search for this synthesiser sound by moving white dots on the tablet.
Each geometrical shape on the screen is linked to a synthesiser parameter, an audio effect, or a left/right stereo effect.
If there are multiple white dots, you can use several fingers at the same time if you wish.

Warning: the research time is limited, but you should not wait for the end of the countdown!
As soon as you think being close to the result, click on OK or push the green key of the keyboard.

3 - After the research, your score will be displayed, and the experiment will pause before triggering the next step.
A noise might be heard during that pause.



This listen/search/pause cycle will occur 22 times, starting with 2 trial cycles for you to train and get used the the touch app.

The experiment will last between 25 and 30 minutes (including questions).
Your final score will be the sum of all previous scores.
